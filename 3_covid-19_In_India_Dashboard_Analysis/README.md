Pleased to share my latest project on "Covid-19 Dashboard Analysis", created using real-world Covid-19 data with a special focus on design, color usage. I'm happy with the final result and would love to hear feedback from the hashtag#datafam community.

During the project, I utilized various Tableau features such as:

Maps: Total deaths by state
Donut Charts: Age group by total cases
Line Charts: Covid cases by state
Bar Charts: ICMR testing labs in each state
Filters: Gender without missing data
State-wise Testing Details
Comparative Analysis: First vs. second dose administration
Vaccine Distribution: Doses administered by vaccine type
The dashboard features multiple views, allowing for a comprehensive exploration of Covid-19 data:

Overview Page: Provides key metrics and insights into the Covid-19 pandemic.
State Comparison: Allows for a detailed comparison of data across different states.
The user has the flexibility to switch between various metrics, such as total cases, deaths, and testing efforts, enabling a multifaceted analysis of the data.

Besides the technical analysis in Tableau, I've been focusing on learning and experimenting with different designs in each project. This approach helps me enhance the usability and effectiveness of the dashboards, ensuring they are both visually appealing and functional.
