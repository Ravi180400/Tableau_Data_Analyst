The HR Analytics project began with the goal of addressing a critical business issue faced by many organizations: high employee attrition rates. Employee turnover can be costly and disruptive, impacting team morale and the organization's overall productivity. In an ever-competitive market, retaining top talent has become a key focus for HR departments worldwide.

The project was initiated when the HR team noticed a worrying trend of increasing attrition rates over the past year. It became essential to understand the root causes of this attrition and identify actionable insights to improve employee retention.
To provide a comprehensive analysis of employee attrition, understand key factors contributing to turnover, and offer data-driven insights to help the HR team make informed decisions.
